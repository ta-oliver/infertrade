\justify Intuitively, assuming a positive coefficient for k,  this means that when the signal is high it is good to buy the market, as the price will tend to drift higher. When the signal is low, it is good to sell the market as the price will tend to drift lower.

\Centering An example of a time series that might show a predictive level relationship would be a sentiment index:

\vspace{1mm}

\justify
We would typically not expect a signal that is a price forecast to show a predictive level relationship, as a price forecast is typically relative to the current price (a difference relationship). Similarly, a technical positioning indicator as a signal may be more likely to show a change relationship, whereby changes in the value of a signal drive the price, because a stable level of interest may not move the market.

A predictive level relationship could be reflected in many kinds of rules. InferTrade uses a 120 period (6 months for daily data) rolling regression of the signal $\research_\currenttime$ against next day's observed percentage price change $\Delta \price_{\currenttime+1}$ as a benchmark to detect level relationships. This section describes in detail this simple strategy allocation recipe that InferTrade used to detect this relationship, but any kind of rule that takes bigger positions when the signal is higher (assuming k is positive) would generate a predictive edge. We provide the below explanation so that you can replicate the results you have obtained on an independent platform and/or modify further to match your trading and investment needs.

The rolling regression level relationship trading rule recommends taking a position sized as a percentage of the capital you have allocated to trading this particular market and will show higher returns than usual if a significant level relationship is present between the price and signal series.
\vspace{1mm}
\justify
To calculate how much to invest, InferTrade first performs a standard rolling linear regression of the observed daily price changes $\Delta \price_{\currenttime} = \frac{\price_{\currenttime}}{\price_{\currenttime-1}} - 1$ against the previous day's research levels $\research_{\currenttime-1}$ for a rolling window of length $\lookbacklength$. This creates an equation for estimating the future percentage price change to occur from today to tomorrow $\Delta \price_{\currenttime+1}$ using today's research level $\research_{\currenttime}$:
\\


\vspace{1mm}
\begin{equation}
\Delta \price_{\currenttime+1} = k_1 \research_\currenttime+k_2 + \epsilon_{\currenttime+1}
\label{eqn:levelregression}
\end{equation}

\justify with the error symmetric such that

\begin{equation}
E^{model}_{\currenttime}[\Delta \price_{\currenttime+1}] = k_1 \research_\currenttime+k_2
\label{eqn:regressionforecast}
\end{equation}


\vspace{1mm}
\justify where $E^{model}_{\currenttime}[\Delta \price_{\currenttime+1}]$ is the predicted next day percentage price change, $\research_\currenttime$ is the research value at time $\currenttime$, and $k_1$ and $k_2$ are the level  and static coefficients. $\epsilon_\currenttime$ represents the in sample regression error between the model predicted and observed price change for time \currenttime, such that $\epsilon_\currenttime = E^{model}_{\currenttime-1}[\Delta \price_{\currenttime}] - \Delta \price_{\currenttime}$. 

\vspace{1mm}
\justify To give a suggested portfolio allocation $\position_\currenttime$ for the market, e.g. ``invest 5\% of strategy allocation into the security'', the regression forecast's expected next day \% price move is divided by the square of the Standard Root Mean Squared Percentage Prediction Error $\rmserrorsquared$ in our above regression:
\vspace{1mm}
\\



\vspace{1mm}
\begin{equation}
    \position_\currenttime = 
    \begin{cases}
    \frac{\Delta \price_{\currenttime+1}}{\rmserrorsquared} & \text{if } \currenttime > L,\\
    0                                        & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}\label{eq:Suggested_Allocation}
\end{equation}



\vspace{1mm}
\justify where $\position_\currenttime$ is the suggested allocation as a percentage of the capital which you have allocated to trading this market at time $\currenttime$.

\justify Worked example for liquid market:  current share price is \$50, regression coefficients are 0.00005 ($5\times 10^{-5}$) for level and 0.0 for the constant, with \$1,000 allocated to this single-stock strategy.  The current research series - a sentiment index - is +5.0, with a RMS prediction error from the regression of 5\%. In this situation the strategy recipe recommends an investment of $0.00005  5.0 / (0.05)^2 = 10\%$ be allocated. So \$1,000 * 10\% = \$100 would be allocated, so we would buy $\frac{\$100}{\$100} = 2$ shares.
We see from this example the expected gain over the next day is 2.5 basis points (minus trading costs), versus 500 basis points of daily risk, so in practice this kind of strategy is most useful where the signal both has a predictive edge and is stable (auto-correlated) in recommendation over time, so that the `edge' from multiple time steps can compound linearly without incurring additional bid-offer spreads whilst the `risk' aggregates scales with the square-root of time (for random walk).


\vspace{1mm}
\justify (Note that if the magnitude of the error term is smaller than the magnitude of the price change prediction, i.e. $|\rmserror| < |\Delta\price_{\currenttime+1}|$, dividing $\Delta\price_{\currenttime+1}$ by $\rmserrorsquared$ would result in $\position_\currenttime>1$. Limits can then be applied to cap the allocation. E.g. between 0\% and 100\% if short selling is prohibited. In practice it is generally unlikely that in liquid markets a genuine statistical trading signal this strong will be found.)

\justify For estimating the regression coefficients, a rolling window is used, so that at time t, the
regression data uses research data from time $\currenttime - 121$ to $\currenttime - 1$ to calculate 120 research changes as the regression’s independent variable. Price data from $\currenttime - 120$ to $\currenttime$ is used to calculate 120 next day price changes as the regression’s dependent variable.
